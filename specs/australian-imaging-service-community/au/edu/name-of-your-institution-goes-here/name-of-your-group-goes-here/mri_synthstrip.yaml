  description: SynthStrip is a skull-stripping tool that extracts brain voxels from
    a landscape of image types, ranging across imaging modalities, resolutions, and
    subject populations. It leverages a deep learning strategy to synthesize arbitrary
    training images from segmentation maps, yielding a robust model agnostic to acquisition
    specifics.
