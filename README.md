# Australian Imaging Service Pipelines - Community

Community contributed pipelines for the Australian Imaging Service.

Pipelines defined in this repository will be automatically built and deployed
to the Australian Imaging Service (after security screening) so they are
available to be run using the AIS' integrated container service.
